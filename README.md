### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Math student dropout that fell in love with programming some 10 years ago.

For most of my career I've been working with enterprises in the fields of banking, insurance and energy sectors. I've mostly written code for the web. I'm a strong advocate of the opinion that strong CS fundamentals very much defines any good programmer.

**Favorite languages**:
- JavaScript, Go, Haskell, C

As of now:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Front End lead for project under the [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/) family. 
- ðŸŒ± My goal for 2025 is to try to redefine my place in this ever-evolving tech world.
