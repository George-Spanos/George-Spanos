Programmer with some 10 years of experience.

Trying to make programming a hobby again.

For most of my career I've been working with enterprises in the fields of banking, insurance and energy sectors. I've written a lot of browser code. I'm a strong advocate of the opinion that strong CS fundamentals very much defines any good programmer.

**Favorite languages**:
- JavaScript, Go, Haskell, C

As of now:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Front End lead for project under the [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/) family. 
- ðŸŒ± My goal for 2025 is to try to redefine my place in this ever-evolving tech world.
