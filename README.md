I am George Spanos, a Software Engineer and Entrepreneur with about 10 years of experience.

I enjoy writing code and designing system that provide value to people.

For most of my career I've been working with enterprises in the fields of banking, insurance and energy sectors. I've been mostly a UI oriented Software Engineer, heavily relying on User Experience principles. Having worked with multiple technologies, my tech stack is quite versatile, making use of multiple patterns and practices I've learnt from different Languages/Frameworks over the years.

**Tech Stack**:
- Languages: JavaScript/TypesScript, Go
- Frameworks: Nuxt, Vue, Angular, Express
- Databases: Postgres, MongoDB
- CI/CD: Docker, Github Actions

As of now:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Front End lead for project under the [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/) family. 
- ðŸŒ± My goal for 2024 is to learn more about Functional Programming, UX/UI Design and Research.
