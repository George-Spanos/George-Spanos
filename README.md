I am George Spanos, a Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience in creating useful applications from Start Ups to Enterprises. 

For most of my career I've been working with greek enterprises in the fields of banking, insurance and energy sectors. I've been mostly a UI oriented Software Engineer, heavily relying on User Experience prisciples. Having worked with multiple technologies, my tech stack is quite versatile, making use of multiple patterns and practices I've learnt from different Languages/Frameworks over the years.

Aside from creating software solutions, I've also been responsible of managing some projects for the clients mentioned above. Having done that I consider myself capable of deeply understanding business needs and being able to prioritize what is useful software versus what is ideal. 

**Tech Stack**:
- Languages: TypesScript, Go, Dart, C#
- Frameworks: Angular, React, ExpressJs, Flutter, .NET
- Databases: Postgres, MongoDB, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL
- Tools: Docker, Github Actions, Azure, Figma

As of now:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my skills in Flutter and Go.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more on Networks, CI/CD and DevOps.
